# 👋 Hey, I'm Peige Guo  

I'm an **AI Software Engineer** passionate about building systems that *see, reason, and act*.  
I love bringing computer vision, robotics, and generative AI together to make automation smarter, safer, and more human-aware.  

---

### 🧠 What I Do
- Design **end-to-end AI pipelines** — from data generation to model deployment on edge and cloud.  
- Build **vision and generative AI systems** for robotics, manufacturing, and intelligent monitoring.  
- Experiment with **agentic and RAG-based architectures**, blending LLMs, vector databases, and multimodal reasoning.  
- Tinker with **PyTorch**, **LangChain**, **TensorRT**, **Docker**, and all things **FastAPI**.

### 🛠️ Tech Playground
`PyTorch` · `Hugging Face` · `LangChain` · `LangGraph` · `TensorRT` · `FastAPI`  
`Docker` · `Kubernetes` · `AWS` · `ROS2` · `3D Vision` · `Python` · `C++`

### 💡 Open-Source Philosophy
I believe open-source AI should be *transparent, reproducible, and collaborative*.  
Most of my side projects explore **vision-language models**, **RAG pipelines**, and **agent frameworks** for real-world automation.  
If you’re experimenting with similar ideas — let’s connect and build something cool together 🚀

### 📚 Background
- Currently at **Musashi AI North America**, developing agentic and multimodal AI systems for industrial automation.  
- Previously built agricultural and robotic vision systems at **Vineland Research** and **DaoAI Robotics**.  
- M.A.Sc. in **Robotics** from *McMaster University*.
